    openingGreeting: You come across a casual bear in the forest. He's looking at
      you in more than a casual way.
    winningGreeting: You have swayed the bear with your supreme style and good looks.
      As you leave you see him setting forest fires in the distance.
    losingGreeting: The bear looks at you with a blank stare as he slowly douses your
      mangled corpse in gasoline and lights it on fire. The memory of you is lost
      in the resulting destruction and millions of dollars in property damages.

    - TextOptions:
      - Play your magical fiddle

      result: 3
    - TextOptions:
      - Insult his mother
      reaction: The bear charges after you, but you are able to avoid his attacks

        giving you a chance to escape
